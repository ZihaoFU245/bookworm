This blog covered how to install alpine linux on raspberry pi zero2w, install
OpenSSH, build zeroclaw against musl (latest or minor versions may not include musl support)
and configure zeroclaw with OpenRC init system.

## Introduction

Zeroclaw is an Openclaw alternative, an autonomous AI agent. Openclaw is written in TypeScript, I do not like it at all. The runtime is heavy, while
zeroclaw written in RUST, the response is almost instant. It is light, fast, efficient and superior to openclaw.

## Flash Alpine linux image onto raspi zero2w {#Flash}

Download the official [raspberry pi imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/), and plug the SD card into your computer, follow its steps and
flash the alpine Linux image.

The alpine linux image provided is a diskless image, which means the entire system will be running on RAM, we will configure that later when we log
into the machine. Don't unplug the SD card yet, we need to preconfigure OpenSSH.

## Preconfigure OpenSSH on alpine linux {#ssh}

Due to alpine linux nature, secure and minimum. It does not bundle the OpenBSD secure shell. We need a bootstrap program, that
executed on the first boot and bring us OpenSSH. [Alpine Linux BootStrap Repo.](https://github.com/macmpi/alpine-linux-headless-bootstrap)
Go to that github repo, download headless.apkovl.tar.gz and place it under /boot, the partition usually called PIBOOT. 

Then configure wifi with
```bash
wpa_passphrase 'YOUR_WIFI_NAME' 'YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD' > wpa_supplicant.conf
```

If you want to use ssh public key login, place your public key inside a file called `authorized_keys`.

Finally save all your modifications and eject it. Plug it in your raspi zero2w and boot it. 

Try ssh into your machine. If it did not respond, ping it first, then try again.
I found the raspi zero2w alping wifi firmware quite unstable, so ping it first,
could save you lots of time debugging. [Alpine WIKI wireless driver post installation](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi#Wireless_drivers)

After gaining access, run `setup-alpine` to make a proper installation on raspi zero2w,
then reboot, and `apk update && apk upgrade` to keep software up to date.

## Build zeroclaw against musl C libray {#build}

Here comes the interesting part. If you go to zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw, you will find out they don't always provide linux-aarch64-musl binary. x86 and arm64
glibc is usually provided, musl is ignored often. Then we must build it ourselves. The most straight forward way is to use a docker container as
builder. 

Alpine uses musl libc instead of glibc. Prebuilt binaries targeting glibc will fail to run.
Therefore we build inside an Alpine environment to ensure compatibility.

```bash
docker run -it --dns 1.1.1.1  alpine:latest /bin/sh
```

You will now inside containers root. It's recommend to check the network connections `ping 8.8.8.8` and `nslookup google.com`.

### First install build essentials

```bash
apk update
apk upgrade
apk add curl git gcc build-base

curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh  # Install Rust
```
### Build the binary

```bash
# Clone the repo
# You can specify a release tag, and clone with
# git clone --branch <tag name> --depth 1 https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw.git
# This will save some time, and use smaller storage
git clone https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw.git

git switch --detach <release tag name> # Find the latest release tag on github

cargo build --release
```

### Transfer out the binary

You will find the binary at `target/release`, transfer it out to your destination. If your firewall
allows containers to reach LAN, you can try `scp zeroclaw <YOUR NAME>@<LAN IP ADDRESS>`

Otherwise, use `croc`, [schollz/croc](https://github.com/schollz/croc), which uses a public
relay node provided by the author to transfer file. Also please consider donation to this beautiful opensource
software.

## Deploy and configure zeroclaw {#deploy}

Now comes to the final section, deploy `zeroclaw` to the target machine, you should now have
the binary on your target machine.

### Install zeroclaw

Install zeroclaw to local machine, `mv ./zeroclaw /usr/local/bin/`.
You should verify with `which zeroclaw` and `zeroclaw --version`, if instruction set matches,
you should not encounter any errors.

### Configure zeroclaw daemon

Alpine linux uses OpenRC init system. First add a dedicated user for zeroclaw.

```bash
adduser zeroclaw
# I should prompt you to enter password
# Do not give Agent full root permission is a good practice
``` 

Here we onboard zeroclaw
```bash
su - zeroclaw
# Follow onboard instructions, after you finish
# run `exit` return to root user
```

Next configure the daemon unit file, `vi /etc/init.d/zeroclaw`,
press i enter insert mode. Here is a example unit file.

```conf
#!/sbin/openrc-run

name="zeroclaw"
description="ZeroClaw daemon"

command="/usr/local/bin/zeroclaw"
command_args="--config-dir /home/zeroclaw/.zeroclaw daemon"
command_user="zeroclaw:zeroclaw"
directory="/home/zeroclaw"

supervisor="supervise-daemon"
pidfile="/run/${RC_SVCNAME}.pid"

output_log="/var/log/zeroclaw/access.log"
error_log="/var/log/zeroclaw/error.log"

export HOME="/home/zeroclaw"
umask 027

depend() {
    need net
    after firewall
}

start_pre() {
    checkpath -d -o zeroclaw:zeroclaw -m 0755 /home/zeroclaw/.zeroclaw
    checkpath -d -o zeroclaw:zeroclaw -m 0755 /var/log/zeroclaw
}
```

Use `rc-service start zeroclaw` to start zeroclaw service, and use
`rc-update add zeroclaw default` to make it presistent even after reboot.

## Ending

Raspi zero2w is a very tiny computer about 15$,
with quad A53 core running at 1.0GHz and 512 MB of RAM. 
Alpine linux is super light, which takes about 30MB of ram after boot. 
Zeroclaw is light weight as well, uses about 20-30 MB. 
I also intalled tailscale on it, this will take another few MB. In total, it used about
70MB.

```bash
zihao@alpine:~$ free -h
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:         416.6M       65.8M      180.3M      320.0K      170.4M      340.1M
Swap:             0           0           0
```
